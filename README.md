# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## MOVAPI

This project was made to practice React.js and the consume of external APIs, takes information from a RapidApi API every time we search for a movie. 
It will provide us with an image, a title and information about the actors and year of release.

**Note:** The application may not work, as it has a current usage plan of 500 request per month. Once this limit is reached, the application is blocked until the following month. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
